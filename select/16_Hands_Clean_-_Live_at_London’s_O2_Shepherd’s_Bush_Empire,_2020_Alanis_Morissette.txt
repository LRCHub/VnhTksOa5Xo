If it weren't for your maturity
None of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years
I would've been able to control myself, and
If it weren't for my attention
You wouldn't have been successful, and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh, this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

And we'll fast forward to a few years later and
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

You're essentially an employee
And I like you having to depend on me, and
You're a kind of protégé
And one day you'll say you learned all you know from me, and
I know you depend on me
Like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me
Like a young thing would, and I think I like it

Ooh, this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind, and
Oh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

And we'll fast forward to a few years later and
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

And what part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
And what part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious

Just make sure you don't tell on me
Especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves
And not tell any members of our inner posse, and
I wish I could tell the world
'Cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly, and
I might want to marry you one day
If you watch that weight and you keep your firm body, and

Ooh, this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind
And oh, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

And we'll fast forward to a few years later and
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this
